		"description": "Created in 2009, scikit-rf (aka skrf) is a free, open-source Python library designed to make radio frequency (RF) engineering both reliable and accessible. scikit-rf is used worldwide in industry and research across sectors such as space, defense, telecommunications, and electronics. In a domain previously dominated by commercial software, scikit-rf, with over 2 million downloads and more than a hundred citations in scientific literature, has become a reference library for the analysis of radio frequency devices. In November 2024, the French Ministry of Higher Education and Research awarded the Open Science Prize for Open-Source Research Software to the scikit-rf project.",
