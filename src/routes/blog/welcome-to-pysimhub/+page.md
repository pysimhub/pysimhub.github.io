We're excited to announce the launch of **PySimHub**, a community hub for Python simulation and numerics tools!

## Our Mission

The Python ecosystem has an incredible wealth of simulation libraries spanning robotics, fluid dynamics, discrete-event simulation, agent-based modeling, and many more domains. However, discovering these tools can be challenging—they're often siloed within specific communities and hard to find unless you already know where to look.

PySimHub aims to solve this by creating a **unified discovery platform** where researchers, engineers, and developers can explore simulation tools across all domains.

## What We Cover

Our catalog spans multiple simulation domains:

- **Robotics** - Robot simulation, kinematics, and motion planning
- **Fluid Dynamics** - CFD, flow simulation, and turbulence modeling
- **Discrete-Event** - Process simulation and queueing systems
- **Agent-Based** - Multi-agent systems and emergent behavior
- **System Dynamics** - Feedback loops and block diagram models
- **FEM/PDE** - Finite element methods and PDEs
- **Molecular Dynamics** - Molecular simulation and chemistry
- **Control Systems** - Control theory and automation

## Open from Day One

PySimHub is **open to submissions from day one**. If you've built or maintain a Python simulation library, we want to hear from you! Submit your project through our [GitHub Issue template](/submit) and join our growing catalog.

## The Team

PySimHub is a collaborative effort led by:

- **Peter Corke** - Distinguished Professor of Robotic Vision, creator of the Robotics Toolbox
- **Jared Callaham** - Researcher in data-driven methods for dynamical systems
- **Milan** - Developer of PathSim and simulation enthusiast

## What's Next

We have exciting plans for PySimHub:

1. **Growing the catalog** - We're actively seeking submissions from the community
2. **Automated updates** - Soon, project statistics will update automatically from GitHub
3. **Community features** - Blog posts, tutorials, and eventually a small conference

## Get Involved

There are several ways to contribute to PySimHub:

- **Submit a project** - [Add your simulation library](/submit) to our catalog
- **Spread the word** - Share PySimHub with your colleagues and communities
- **Contribute** - Help improve the website on [GitHub](https://github.com/pysimhub)

Thank you for being part of the Python simulation community. We're excited to build this together!
